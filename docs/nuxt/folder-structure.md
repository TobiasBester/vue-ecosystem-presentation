## Folder Structure
Folder structure is meant to organize and to be functional.
A generated project comes with READMEs in each folder describing what
they are for.

- /components - standard, reusable components
- /pages - root level components
- /layouts - containers for pages
- /store - namespaced Vuex modules
- /test - E2E and unit tests
- /static - root-level server assets
- /plugins
- /middleware
- nuxt.config.js

::: tip
Routes can be customized in the nuxt.config.js [👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-router/).
