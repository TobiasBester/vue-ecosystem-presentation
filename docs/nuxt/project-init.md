## Project Initialization

`npx nuxt-create-app`

Specify JS or TS, additional packages, linter, testing framework, etc.

Similar to Vue CLI but adds options for Axios, CMS, UI Library, CI/CD tools,
plus comes with vue-router, Vuex, and vue-meta already.

Project is initialized with specific folder structure...
